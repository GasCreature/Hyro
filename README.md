A Live, desktop, HTML5 text-editor. You can now code HTML5 websites in real-time on your desktop.


# Install
Hyro is compatible for all Platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux (32-bit).

**or** if you're a node.js (node-webkit) developer

Clone the github repository 'michael-brade/Hyro' and hack as you please.

The current version is 0.1.0.

# Usage
It has a basic UI. You type in your code on the **left** and see what your HTML looks like on the **right**.

Moreover, you can open multiple files and **execute javascript within the page**

If you dislike the primary UI color, you can change the color by choosing the 'Change Color' item in the **View** menu-item. **(not stable/persistent yet)**

Overall, the Hyro app is a lightweight development tool that I made to make frontend testing faster and easier. It is not meant to be a complete supplement for Sublime Text and Vim, but if you use it for these purposes that's alright. Also, If you would like to raise an issue/bug or make a pull request, you are more than welcome to and I will do my best to help solve the problem.

Thank you and happy hacking.
